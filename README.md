# Optimal-Bid-Markup-Calculator

Developed a statistical bidding strategy model to determine the optimal mark-up percentage for maximum expected profit. Utilized historical data to compute the probability of winning against competitors using Friedmanâ€™s model. Implemented the solution in C++ for accurate and efficient mark-up calculations.
